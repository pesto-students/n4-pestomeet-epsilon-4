# PESTO MEET BACK-END


#### Overview:
PestoMeet is a digital platform that lives on a responsive mobile-friendly website. Its main aim is to help students, mentors, and organizers efficiently manage and track the programs/batches organized by pesto-tech.

#### Why PestoMeet?
We observe some potential problems in the pesto-tech program, hence PestoMeet attempts to solve the following problem.

 1.Mentors Assigned and buddy pairing is manual
 
 2.Masterclasses were scheduled in google meet and if students missed the masterclass, then organizers need to call them manually to remind them for attendance.
 
 3.Even though a mentor meetings scheduler is available it lacks a proper reminding system.
 
 4.Better resource management for masterclass recorded video or assignments.
